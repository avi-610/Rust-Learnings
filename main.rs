fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");

}
// This line is known as 'comment line' which will not be executed with the program.
//we have created a main function under which 'hello ,world!' will be printed with the help of println!()
//println!() adds a new line character (enter) at the end, so the second text is printed in the next line. 
//main() function is the entry point of every rust program. We have to call every function inside main().
